# Fast-Square-Fill
Simple Python square filling function that utilizes steps instead of two loops. The time complexity is O(A), where A is area. While this may have the same time complexity as two loops, this exchanges one loop for simple math equations.
# Side Note
This function is 87 times slower than two loops and isn't useful in most circumstances
